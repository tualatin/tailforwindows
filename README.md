Tail4Windows
==============
## Project is closed

Unfortunately, I will finally close the Tail4Windows project. For private reasons, I will no longer be able to wait for the project to the best of my conscience in the future. It was a pleasure for me to develop Tail4Windows, to this day I use it professionally and the program does its service reliably.
If you are interested in further developing Tail4Windows, especially porting it to NETCORE, you are welcome to do so. I would be very grateful for a hint.
Thanks to everyone who believed in the program and worked on it.

## Professional log reader for Windows

In order to monitor changes to your computer, the windows system generates log files containing errors and warnings. These files provide you with important details about any change that occurred in your system. It is hard to monitor all these files at once, since the data inside of them is constantly changing.

Tail4Windows is a handy tool that offers a solution to this problem. The application allows you to monitor the changes that affect your system, by monitoring the entries of your log files, in the formats of LOG and TXT.

## Sturdy log monitor with user-friendly interface

This application allows you the possibility to keep track of all the changes that programs generate to your system, by monitoring the log files created by each one.

Depending on the affect of certain programs, the priority of individual log files can be increased accordingly. This comes in handy for applications that automatically save data, as you can track them every time they do so.

## Dependable log file monitoring tool

Tail4Windows helps you filter the information saved by your log files, so that you get notified whenever a change, that interests you, occurs. This way, you can check specific changes that have been applied to your system, disregarding minor modifications.

Aside from this, you can easily print these log files and share them with others that might offer you a detailed description regarding the changes made to your system.

## A handy and powerful monitor for log files

To summarize, Tail4Windows allows you to monitor any changes to your system with ease, by tracking new entries in the log files of certain applications and processes.
